## Project Description
The **Lead-to-Cash (L2C) process** encompasses all steps from lead generation to revenue collection. This project leverages **AI and machine learning** to optimize the L2C workflow by addressing inefficiencies such as inaccurate lead scoring, sales pipeline bottlenecks, and revenue leakage. Key areas of focus include:

- **Lead Scoring & Qualification**: Using predictive analytics to identify high-potential leads.
- **Sales Pipeline Optimization**: Automating opportunity management and sales forecasting.
- **Dynamic Pricing & Fraud Detection**: Enhancing pricing strategies and identifying fraudulent transactions.
- **Customer Retention & Upselling**: Improving post-sale engagement through personalized offers.

The project aims to reduce human intervention, improve decision-making, and enhance overall sales efficiency.

## Data Sources
Two primary datasets are used for this project:

1. **Bank Marketing Dataset**  
   - **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
   - **Description**: Contains customer interaction data from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. Key columns include customer demographics, financial details, and campaign outcomes.  
   - **Use Case**: Optimizing lead qualification, opportunity management, and customer retention.

2. **CRM + Sales + Opportunities Dataset**  
   - **Source**: Kaggle  
   - **Description**: Includes data on leads, sales opportunities, and customer interactions. Key columns include lead source, opportunity stage, expected revenue, and payment status.  
   - **Use Case**: Enhancing lead scoring, sales forecasting, and order fulfillment processes.
