# AI-Driven Lead to Cash (L2C) Process Optimization - Capstone Project 

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Lead to Cash (L2C)** process includes all steps from lead generation to revenue collection. This project leverages **AI-driven automation** to enhance efficiency, reduce human intervention, and improve decision-making in sales workflows.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional L2C processes face several challenges:
- Inaccurate lead scoring
- Sales pipeline bottlenecks
- Revenue leakage  
By integrating AI models, we aim to optimize the L2C workflow through **automation and predictive insights**.

## 🔍 Proposed AI-Powered L2C Process
AI is used to analyze sales data, predict customer behavior, and automate processes to enhance efficiency. Key areas of improvement include:
- **Lead Scoring:** Identifying high-potential leads
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Optimizing price recommendations
- **Fraud Detection:** Preventing revenue loss
- **Customer Retention:** Enhancing engagement strategies

## 📊 Datasets Used
We use two primary datasets to drive insights:
1. **CRM + Sales + Opportunities Dataset** (Customer behavior and sales trends) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/crm-sales-opportunities)
2. **Bank Marketing Dataset** (Financial transaction patterns and marketing insights)(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)

## 🤖 AI Models & Technologies Used
The project utilizes various AI and machine learning techniques:
- **Predictive Analytics:** Decision Trees, XGBoost
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Chatbots & Sentiment Analysis:** BERT, LSTM
- **Fraud Detection:** Isolation Forest, Autoencoders
- **Demand Forecasting:** ARIMA, LSTMs
- **Recommendation Systems:** Collaborative Filtering

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
2. **Model Selection & Training**
3. **Deployment & Integration**
4. **Performance Monitoring & Optimization**

## 📈 Business Impact
The feasibility of AI-driven L2C optimization is evaluated based on:
- **Data Availability & Quality**
- **Model Accuracy & Complexity**
- **Business Value & ROI**

### 🌟 Expected Benefits:
- Improved sales efficiency  
- Reduced customer churn  
- Increased revenue  

## 🔮 Conclusion & Future Scope
AI-driven L2C transformation enhances decision-making and automation. Future improvements include:
- Expanding datasets for more accurate predictions
